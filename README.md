# Ollama A.I. Panelist GUI App

This project is a GUI application that simulates an interactive panel of AI agents that respond to user questions as panelists. The app, built with `Tkinter`, leverages the `Ollama` API to allow AI agents to provide conversational responses. Each agent acts as a panelist with a unique personality, and the user can ask questions to the panel and receive multiple AI-driven responses.

## Features

- **Customizable AI Panelists**: The app supports multiple AI panelists that provide unique responses to user questions.
- **Dynamic Conversations**: AI panelists engage in continuous conversation, asking questions and responding to both the user and other panelists.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with `Tkinter`, the app provides a scrolled chat window for displaying user questions and AI responses.
- **Random Name Generation**: Each AI panelist is assigned a unique name to ensure a dynamic panel of agents.
